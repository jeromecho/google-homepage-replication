Start every task with the goal in mind. I read that in a good book once, maybe I should apply it

Goals: 

- Refresh memory on Git workflow 
- Become a keyboard master on Linux, opening files with mere commands
- Exercise mindfulness during coding to maximize deep work 
- Ah! Use dev tools to reverse engineer a sexy Google homepage. 

I might have to read more README's to get a better idea for what to use this space for. 

UPDATE:
