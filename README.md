# Project aim: 

 To reverse engineer the Google.com home page (at least in design) using HTML and CSS. This project also involes getting comfortable with dev tools and project basics (such as Github).

# Tasks: 

1. Put main elements on page (logo and search form) 
2. Build navbar across top 
3. Recreate footer. 
4. Celebrate euphoria of getting code to work. 

Final Look: (not half bad, eh?)

Notes: the language settings of this Google homepage are in Japanese. Content should be the same, however.

Takeaways: 

- Use CSS resets to avoid problems with browser formatting 
- Google is your friend 
- Mindful coding allows more concise coding
